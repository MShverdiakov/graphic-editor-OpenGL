# graphic-editor-OpenGL
Creating a simple graphic editor using OpenGL with 3D graphics of spinning disk with O-cat meme. (Can draw lines, rectangles, polygons, triangles, change colors, line styles, scale and so one)

first try was main and pyopengl part, but then i realized that i need to use opengl for all drawing, so relevant code on menu_test.py
